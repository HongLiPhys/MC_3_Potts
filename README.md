# MC_3_Potts
This is a julia code for Monte Carlo simulation of three Potts model
M_curve_h value.dat files are the magnetization curves
n_map_h value.dat files are the vector order maps
These two sets of data are generated by the code in MC.jl file
The model is on crystal lattice with lattice constant a = (1,0), b = (0,1). The XY coordinate lattice constants are: a = (1,0), b = (1/2,sqrt(3)/2);
It takes roughly 10 minutes to generate all data files.
